For the advanced features, there are no files, just simple instructions, but these only pertain to the Linux based installations.

There are some advanced features you can install at this point depending on what you want to do.

In order to access these advanced features, go to the command line on the server the OpenNMS installation is installed on.

server#> ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost

Type in your password.

Here are some commands to get you started. The nice part about this is that you can start typing, press tab, and get a list of possibilities.

To get a help menu of available commands, you can type help and press enter.

feature:list
bundle:list
feature:install <type feature name here>
help

You can see there is a large number of different features you can install.

The next section of this notebook will cover ALEC, OpenNMS's AI/Machine Learning feature installation and setup.
